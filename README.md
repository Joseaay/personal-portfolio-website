> Code for my current personal website

<img align="right" src="./src/static/images/screenshot.gif" alt="Screenchot" width="380" />
The idea is to have a special spot in the internet for sharing all my projects and personal achivements.

The website will have the following:

-   Self-description and a bit of my life story.
-   Description of jobs I've had and companies I've worked for.
-   Show cases of different projects I've worked in.
-   Cool samples of FrontEnd animations or libraries that I work with.
-   A breakdown graphic of my technical skills and tech set.
-   Contact section for being able to reach me

> This project is a **_WORK IN PROGRESS_** development so I'll be filling up all the different sections little by little.

## `Theme Idea`

👽 **Outspace themed** 👽

The website will have a space-themed vibe. The idea is to make the user feel like he is in a space trip, seen the earth from the distant and going through the different sections of the website as if he was jumping between planets.

# Tech Stack

-   ReacJS
-   SASS
-   ThreeJS
-   Pm2

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
